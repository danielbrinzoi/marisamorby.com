# Hi there, I'm Marisa.

I do Design Research and focus my work on new technologies, reducing climate impact, and urban planning. 

## My Mission

In many cases, I think the biggest impact we can make is through focused, incremental change — like an ocean tide rolling over the sand that slowly changes an entire landscape. I believe thoughtful research and design can have a huge, long-lasting, and  positive impact. I do my best to focus on projects and ideas that make us kinder as people, healthier as a planet, and happier with ourselves.

## How I work

- I combine the best ideas from broad areas of study, including behavioral psychology, natural systems, and business, to discover not just _what_ is happening, but _why_ it’s happening, so we can confidently define what we need to learn and how to get there
- I’m a master of identifying the highest-impact problems and working on cross-functional teams toward solutions that get great results

## I love sharing what I’ve learned

I have a few hobbies that I've fallen pretty hard for, and love sharing a lot of different things! You'll find articles about design systems, urban design, research, projects, and skills I’ve gained over the years in an effort to help teach others. There's a lot already there, and more to come!
